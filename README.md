Mercury
======

The forked PvP Game Manager plugin from [PGMDev/PGM](https://github.com/PGMDev/PGM).

Overview
--------

Back in 2011, a Minecraft map creator named dewtroid released a PvP map called [Airship Battle.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dLo8ytygWs) At the time, there were no comprehensive Bukkit plugins to manage PvP matches, so everything was done manually. Then, two young developers named [Apple](https://github.com/tonybruess) and [Anxuiz](https://github.com/anxuiz) came along and created the first version of "PGM" (also known as **P**vP **G**ame **M**anager) to automate the process of playing PvP matches. Later, they would establish the popular Minecraft server network, `Overcast Network` (also know as `oc.tc`). After the network went through a cycle of hyper-growth, stabilization, and eventual closure in 2016, its [plugins](https://github.com/OvercastNetwork/ProjectAres) were open sourced for the community to enjoy. Now in 2020, a young fellow by the name [Destial](https://github.com/destial) forked the now open-source [PGM Plugin](https://github.com/PGMDev/pgm) to be used for his fellow servers.

To be used along side [SportPaper 1.8](https://github.com/Electroid/SportPaper).
